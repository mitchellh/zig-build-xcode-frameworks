# Xcode Framework Headers Packaged for Zig

This project provides an API to depend on the
[hexops/xcode-frameworks](https://github.com/hexops/xcode-frameworks)
repository with the Zig package manager. This is just to work around
a Zig 0.11.0 bug, this won't exist long term and you probably shouldn't
use it.
